* Desciption
I'm using [[https://vulkan-tutorial.com/][Vulkan-Tutorial.com]] to learn Vulkan,
and most of the code found within this project, is likely to be heavily based
upon it.

* Goal
- Learn Vulkan through the writing of a small game.
- Implement Vulkan into the [[https://github.com/TeamAvocado/Avocado][Avocado 3D Engine]].
